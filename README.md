# CryptoBot

This application buys and sells cryptocurrency such as Ether on the Coinbase Pro exchange using an algorithm that takes advantage of short-term price volatility. It collects and analyzes price history data using the coinbasepro-csharp library, computes statistics such as an exponential moving average, then determines and executes trades. Performance is measured and displayed over time.
